    "A case for long data\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons to prefer datasets structured in long\n",
    "form. Repeating some of the points made in Hadley Wickham's\n",
    "[excellent paper on the topic](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html),\n",
    "here are three reasons why you should attempt to structure your data\n",
    "in long form:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have many value variables, it is difficult to summarize\n",
    "wide-form datasets at a glance (which in turn makes it hard to identify\n",
    "mistakes in the data). For example, imagine we have a dataset with 50 years\n",
    "and 10 value variables of interest --- this would result in 500 columns in wide form.\n",
    "Summarizing each column to look for strange observations, or simply understanding\n",
    "which variables are included in the dataset, becomes difficult in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structuring data as key-value pairs --- as is done in long-form\n",
    "datasets --- facilitates conceptual clarity. For example, in\n",
    "`country_long` above, it is clear that the unit of analysis is\n",
    "country-year --- or, put differently, that the variables `country` and\n",
    "`year` jointly constitute the key in the dataset. In wide-form datasets,\n",
    "one of the variables that constitutes the unit of analysis is mixed with\n",
    "a variable that holds values. (Read more about this in Hadley's paper referenced\n",
    "above.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Long-form datasets are often required for advanced statistical\n",
    "analysis and graphing. For example, if you wanted to run a regression with\n",
    "year and/or country fixed effects, you would have to structure your data\n",
    "in long form. Furthermore, many graphing packages, including `ggplot`,\n",
    "rely on your data being in long form. \n"
