    "Up until, we've focused on how to work with R using `.R` plaintext files. `.R` files are excellent when *most* of what you're writing is code, and I continue to recommend them for your research and more intensive R programming. \n",

    "There is, however, a second way to work with R that is often popular for problem sets and developing instructional materials: R Markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "R Markdown is a tool for easily integrating text, code, and code output into a single document. This not only makes R Markdown documents *incredibly* useful for instructional materials (this entire site is actually built with something analogous to R Markdown), but it is also a useful format for sharing simple analyses with colleagues. Using R Markdown, you can not only share the conclusions of your analysis with colleagues, but also the code that generated those analyses, making it easy for others to see how you reached your conclusions, and, crucially, play with that code to see what happens if the analysis is changed slightly. \n",

    "\n",
    "An R Markdown file is actually just a plain text file that (a) has a filename that ends in `.Rmd`, and (b) contains text formatted in a special way. To illustrate, here's a very simple R Markdown notebook:\n",

    "1. Here you see the name of the file. The file name ends in `.Rmd`, which is how RStudio knows this is an R Markdown file.\n",
    "2. This block of text — placed at the top of the document between two sets of three dashes `---` — provides basic metadata about the document, like the title, author, and output format (which we'll talk about below).\n",
    "3. This is where the body of the R Markdown document begins. By default, anything written in the body of an R Markdown document will be treated as text. The heading (`## My Introduction`) is blue because the two hash marks on the left tell R it's a heading, and so RStudio has made it blue to make it easier to read. The text below is, well, just normal text! This is where you might write a summary of what you're going to do below.\n",
    "4. This section is called a *code chunk*, and it consists of everything between the three backticks and `{r}` at the top and the three backticks at the bottom (the `{r}` is there to tell R Markdown this is R code — R Markdown does allow you to also include code in other programming languages).\n",

    "The final thing to explain about R Markdown is that even though an R Markdown document is written in plain text (meaning there are no fonts you can select or font sizes to choose directly), you *can* change the way that text will be rendered when you export your file. That's because your can *mark* your text in ways that communicates to R how you want it to be styled using a language called... Markdown!\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is *great*, and is in no way unique to R Markdown — it's used across the internet, and once you know what it is, you'll find you start seeing it everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if you want to italicize something, you put one star on either side (`*this will be italicized*`), want something bold, put two stars on either side (`**this will be bold**`). Want to write a link, just but the text you want shown in square brackets and the URL of the link immediately after in parentheses (`[this is a link](http://www.link.com)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, if you start a line with `#`, it will be treated as a heading. The more `#` you use, the smaller the heading becomes. Your R Markdown always starts with an implicit title (the one given in the document metadata), so usually the headings you use within an R Markdown document start with two or more `#`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Technically, there are a couple versions of markdown that differ in small ways, but if you follow [this guide you'll be in pretty safe shape](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially for social scientists, R Markdown also supports mathematical notation. If you wrap text in a pair of dollar signs, it will be rendered beautifully on export. For example, `$x_1 + y^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{25} z^i$` becomes $x_1 + y^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{25} z^i$.\n",
