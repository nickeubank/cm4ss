    "But the way we'll mostly *use* R is using a program called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio is a \"helper\" program that makes it easier to work with R (it is what is referred to as an \"editor\" or \"integrated development environment\" (IDE)). When you're working in RStudio, all the code you run is being run by R itself, but RStudio provides tools to make it easier to see what R is doing, to organize the code your write to run in R, to look at plots R generates, etc. In other words, you don't need RStudio to use R (some people use other editors, like VS Code), but you definitely need R to run RStudio, any code you write in RStudio will work anywhere R is available. \n",

In the examples above, R did the math we asked it to do, and printed out the results, but it didn't keep a copy of those results anywhere.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now things get a little more interesting. Instead of a single value being assigned to a variable, we now have an expression. The way R handles this is by first evaluating the expression on the right side of the assignment operator (`<-`), *then* assigning it to the variable. \n",

And if you run the code we just worked through, you'll see that it displays the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` basically the same way we wrote them above: as values in boxes with the variable name next to them as a label!
