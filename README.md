# Computational Methods for Social Scientists

This site is built with `sphinx`, a python-based document builder. 

To build / update the page, navigage to the root folder and run `python -m sphinx source docs/html`

(after installing `sphinx` and `nbsphinx`)

All materials live in `source` as jupyter notebooks, and built to HTML files in `docs/html`.
