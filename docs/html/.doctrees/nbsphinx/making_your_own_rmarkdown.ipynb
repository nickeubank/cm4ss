    "\n",
    "The idea of an R Markdown document is to have ALL the code needed to recreate an analysis embedded in the document where you discuss said analysis. But a common mistake students make is to (a) write and run a code chunk that creates a variable, (b) unintentionally delete or modify that code chunk, but (c) not notice because *in the currently open R session, that variable has already been created*, so other chunks that call the variable still work. \n",
    "\n",
    "But then when the student shares their R Markdown file or runs it on a different day in a new R session, the document won't work any more because the code that created that critical variable is gone *and* in a new R session that variable wasn't already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "![missing code cell](images/rmarkdown_whyrmls.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "**THIS PROBLEM IS NOT CORRECTED BY RESTARTING R** — for whatever reason, R thinks that when R is restarted, it should also reload all variables (which drives me nuts). But it *will* prevent you from exporting your R Markdown to HTML or PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do you guard against this?\n",
    "\n",
    "I **strongly** recommend starting all R Markdown files with `rm(ls=list())` and making sure you can click `Run All` without getting errors. `rm(ls=list())` will remove any variables that are already defined before your code starts so that only variables *defined in the code in the notebook* are accessible to R when it re-runs your notebook."

    "```\n",
