    "Until this point, the scripts we've been writing are quite straightforward: each line of code runs in sequence, one after another. Moreover, everything we want R to do, we have to write out by hand.\n",

    "In this lesson, we'll learn about loops -- a programming structure ideal for getting R to do LOTS of work with very little code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a loop is that in situations where you want R to do lots of very similar things, we can decompose our code into (a) generic code we want to run over and over, and (b) an input to that code that changes each time we repeat the generic code.\n",
