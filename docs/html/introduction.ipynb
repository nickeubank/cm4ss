    "You can run R using a number of text editors or \"integrated\n",
    "development environments\" (IDEs). Most people prefer some other\n",
    "application than R's native environment, which provides only limited\n",
    "functionality in terms of syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and\n",
    "debugging. Alternatives include [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), \n",
    "[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),\n",
    "[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)/[ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/), \n",
    "and many many more. *Most* social scientists using R use RStudio, and so we'll \n",
    "use that here. You can find the official installation instructions \n",
    "[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), but we'd actually recommend \n",
    "[this installation tutorial video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulIv0NiVTs4), \n",
    "which also details the basic funcationality of RStudio. \n",
    "\n",
    "All IDEs include a console and a text editor. The console is where you'll\n",
    "see the results (or *output*) of commands executed from the editor. You can\n",
    "type commands directly into the console, but this is generally not a good\n",
    "strategy. This is because the whole purpose of writing code is to make\n",
    "it reproducible. Typing commands in the text editor will let you\n",
    "come back to them later as long as you save them (using extension .R)."

    "2. **The assignment operator**. R uses `<-` (the assignment\n",

    "`\"hello world\"`, `5`) until the end of your R session.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Class.** R automatically assigns a class to each object\n",
    "you create. Three classes were used above: numeric,\n",
    "character, and logical. Use `class()` to see what type an object is\n",
    "(e.g., `class(hello_world)`, `class(a)`, and `class(x)`). Why is this\n",
