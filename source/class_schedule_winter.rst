Class Schedule (January 2024)
==========================================

This set of four January sessions was originally designed to build on the `seven R bootcamp sessions in August. <class_schedule_fall.rst>`__. Unfortunately, attendance at those sessions was significantly lighter than intended â€” all PhD students and a few Master's students attended those sessions (in person or on zoom), but I know there were quite a few Master's students who were unable to attend for various reasons.

Class Overview
---------------

Because we only have four sessions available, and I would like these sessions to be a useful refresher for those who did not have a great deal of experience with R prior to August, the plan for these sessions will be as follows:

If you did not attend the August sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You will be asked to complete a handful of introductory readings and exercises prior to the first session on January 5th. Those are detailed below.
  - You may complete these readings and exercises on your own schedule, and help will be available in a slack group to which you will be invited. However, I will ask that you submit your completed exercises to ensure everyone is making progress prior to January 5th.
- Attendance will be expected at all four of the sessions being offered, in person or on zoom. As a reminder, these workshops are **mandatory** if you wish to enroll in POLSCI 630.
- If you feel you have extremely strong R skills, please email me at `nick@nickeubank.com <mailto:nick@nickeubank.com>`_ with information about your past experience with R (especially base R, rather than tidyverse tools) and some R code you think demonstrates your expertise with base R.

If you DID attend the August sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You are *welcome* to attend any of the sessions being offered.
- You are **required** to attend the sessions on January 8th (in person or on zoom).
