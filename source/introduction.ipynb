RStudio is a little \"helper\" program that makes it a little easier to write code for R (it is what is referred to as an \"integrated development environment\" (IDE)). There are also a lot of other IDEs, but RStudio is the easiest and one of the most popular. \n",

In screenshot below, for example, I'm about to ask R to print the phrase \"Hello!\" (though I haven't hit return, so it hasn't done anything yet):\n",

    "\n",
    "One last note before we finish off this section: one of the most powerful thing about a language like R is that it's full of pre-made tools called *functions*. A function is basically a little program inside R. They can do everything from simple operations (like adding up numbers) to extremely complicated operations (fit a machine learning model). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a function is that takes in a set of *arguments* as an input, and then it *returns* a result. To use a function, you type out the function name, then place the arguments you want to pass to the function inside parentheses. For example, there's a function called `as.numeric()` that's designed to convert a variable that is a character (like `\"7\"`) to a numeric value (`7`) so we can do arithmatic with that value. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to use it, we pass the function `as.numeric` the variable (`b`). The function will then take the value associated with `b` (`\"7\"`), convert it to a numeric value, then return the converted value. For example:"
