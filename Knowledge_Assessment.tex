{\large \textbf{Knowledge Assessment}} \\
Nick Eubank \& Claire Evans\\
\today
\end{center}

Here are a few questions about your familiarity with R, LaTeX, and other programming tools. It is designed to give us a better sense of people's backgrounds so we can properly calibrate our instruction

A note to future instructors: Knowledge Assessments are great for any class where you are  teaching students you don't know well.

These questions are \textbf{not} test whether you meet prerequisites, because computer camp has \textbf{no prerequisites}. So if the answer to every question below is ``never heard of it,'' that's \textbf{completely fine}.

In fact: If you have experience with another programming language, \textbf{beware!} R does not follow the same conventions as many other languages!
