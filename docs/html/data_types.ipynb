    "Up till now, we've only been working with numbers, but R is actually equiped to work with a number of different *kinds* of data. In the course of this tutorial we'll introduce all of them, but there are really three main ones to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numeric` and `integer`: The main data types for numbers. These two types are *slightly* different (integers is restricted to, we, integers; numeric can be an integer or a number with decimals), but you can think of them as interchangable for now.\n",
    "- `character`: Text data, like a person's name, or a quote from a book. Written with `\"` before and after (or single quotes (`'`) before and after if you'd prefer.\n",
    "- `logical`: Data that only takes on the values of true and false. Written `TRUE` and `FALSE`\n",

    "## A Brief Introduction to Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One last note before we finish off this section: one of the most powerful thing about a language like R is that it's full of pre-made tools called *functions*. A function is basically a little program inside R. They can do everything from simple operations (like adding up numbers) to extremely complicated operations (fit a machine learning model). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a function is that takes in a set of *arguments* as an input, and then it *returns* a result. To use a function, you type out the function name, then place the arguments you want to pass to the function inside parentheses. For example, there's a function called `as.numeric()` that's designed to convert a variable that is a character (like `\"7\"`) to a numeric value (`7`) so we can do arithmatic with that value. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to use it, we pass the function `as.numeric` the variable (`b`). The function will then take the value associated with `b` (`\"7\"`), convert it to a numeric value, then return the converted value. For example:"
