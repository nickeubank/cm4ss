    "# Bootstrapping Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will bring together a range of different tools and skills we've learned — including vector, matrix, and data.frame manipulation, loops, and functions — for a single purpose: calculating bootstrapped standard errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To review, to create a bootstrapped estimate of a coefficient and it's standard error, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Re-sampled our data with replacement:** we take our *actual* 1,000 observations and create a new \"re-sampled\" dataset by picking one random observation to put in our \"new\" data at a time, 1,000 times, but allowing for the same observation to get picked as many times as chance allows. For example, Respondent 1 might not end up in the \"new\" dataset, while Respondent 2 might end up 4 times. This gives us a new dataset that looks a lot like what we would have gotten if we'd actually gone back to our population of interest and collected 1,000 entirely new survey responses.\n",
    "- **Run the regression:** we regress income on gender with this new, re-sampled dataset. This will give us a new estimate of the partial correlation between gender and income ($\\beta$) that should be similar to but distinct from the estimate we got with our original dataset (since some observations didn't make it into this new dataset and some have been repeated).\n",
    "- **Record the new value of $\\beta$:** Just, you know, write it down or store it somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "But don't worry, we aren't going just jump straight to trying to do all that at once. It is **never** a good idea when attempting something complicated (like bootstrapping) to try and \"just write it out.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, the way we will approach this is by building up a script little by little from running a simple regression to taking on the task of doing a full bootstrap."

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be analyzing data from a real world experiment designed to help answer this question. Namely, we will be analyzing data from a randomized experiment in which 4,870 ficticious resumes were sent out to employers in response to job adverts in Boston and Chicago in 2001. The resumes differ in various attributes including the names of the applicants, and different resumes were randomly allocated to job openings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"experiment\" part of the experiment is that resumes were randomly assigned Black- or White-sounding names, and then watched to see whether employers called the \"applicants\" with Black-sounding names at the same rate as the applicants with the White-sounding names.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Which names constituted \"Black-sounding names\" and \"White-sounding names\" was determined by analyzing names on Massachusetts birth certificates to determine which names were most associated with Black and White children, and then surveys were used to validate that the names were perceived as being associated with individuals of one racial category or the other). \n",

Once you find it, you'll be asked to log in, after which you'll have full access to the article. You will also find this pattern holds true at nearly any major University in the US.\n"
