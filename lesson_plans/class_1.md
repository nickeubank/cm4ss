Welcome
- Why R?
  - Not because it is the best, but because of network effects!
- Course expectations
  - Flipped class; gotta do the readings!
- Goals:
  - Not just show you how to load and manipulate data, but provide you a solid foundational understanding of how R works and the programming concepts that underlie it and will generalize not just to advanced R workflows, but also other languages. 
    - I'm not making up my sense of what I think you need to know! I am a social scientist, just like you: I worked for years as an economist at the World Bank before graduate school, and have a PhD in political economy for Stanford. I publish primarily in political science journals, but also some stats journals. I've taught social science undergraduates and PhD students at Stanford, Vanderbilt, and Duke. 
    - I also work regularly in Stata, R, Python, and Julia, and also know some basic Java, so my approach to this course is to try to emphasize the concepts and patterns that I know are common *across* specific tools.
  - May feel a little removed from social science applications up front, but stick with me -- we'll get there by lesson 3. 
  - Even if you have used are in the past, my experience from teaching this class before is that students often leave the class feeling that they now understand *how* R works at a much deeper level. 

## Variable assignment
- Variables are just labels on boxes we can put data in
- Assignment is where we tell R to put data in a specific box
  - What happens if we execute something but don't assign it to a box?
- Talk about order of execution

## Vectors
- Vectors are the building blocks of R!
- Collection of data with a concept of order. 
- All entries of the same type.
