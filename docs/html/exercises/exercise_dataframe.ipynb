    "3. How many observations does `world` have? How many variables? Use an R command to find out.\n",

    "4. Use brackets and a logical statement to inspect all the values for Nigeria and United States. That is, your code should return two entire rows of the dataset. \n",

    "6. What is the lowest GDP per capita in the dataset? (Use R to return only the value.)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What country has the lowest GDP per capita? (Your code should return the country name and be general enough so that if the observations in the dataset --- or their order --- change, your code should still return the country with the lowest GDP per capita.)\n"
