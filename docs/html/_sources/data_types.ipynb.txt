In this section, we'll go over the three data types you'll encounter most -- `numeric`, `character`, and `logical` types -- as well as what it means for R to have these discrete data types. \n",

                "Finally, `logical` data takes on only two values: `TRUE` and `FALSE` (note those values have to be written in all capitals to be recognized by R!). `logical` data can store information about the world (you could have a variable called `female` that only has values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`), but more often we use it for testing. For example, suppose we wanted to test whether a survey respondent's age is over 18 to evaluate whether they are eligible to vote. We'd probably do something like ask whether `age >= 18`, which would evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. "
