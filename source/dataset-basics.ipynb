    "Dataset structure\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "More important than learning the mechanics of creating a dataset in\n",
    "R is to understand their general structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each column should consist of a vector that gives some fact about\n",
    "the world (e.g., age in years). We usually refer to these columns\n",
    "as *variables*. \n",
    "2. At least one column should identify who or what the information in\n",
    "the data is about.  Such a variable is called an \"id\" variable or\n",
    "\"key\". In the `children` dataset above this variable is `name`. The\n",
    "remaining variables have the facts or measurements that we care\n",
    "about. For example, we gather from the dataset that Al is 6 years old\n",
    "(one fact) and that Al has brown hair (a second fact).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the proper structure of datasets, let's create a\n",
    "second data frame. Suppose here that `gdp_pc` is a measure of a\n",
    "country's GDP per capita in a given year. (Use `?expand.grid` and\n",
